# Introduction

Hello everyone! If you're reading this, you're either a close friend of mine or a recruiter. Either way, welcome to my personal blog project! 🚀
This project is special to me—it's my way of expressing thoughts I wouldn't usually say out loud (or maybe I’m just too lazy to say them 😵‍💫).

### About Me  

This project was created by me and only me 🥺 huhu.  
I once thought, "Why not create a website that can express the things I can't say myself?" (Well, more like I'm too lazy to say them). After over two years of laziness, this project is finally here (mainly because I had to focus on my graduation project and making money 🥱).  

Enough chit-chat...  

Hi, I'm Dũng, but my friends call me Dle (Đờ le).
I'm 24 years old and currently working as a developer at an outsourcing company.

I created this blog as a personal project to showcase my development skills and passion for coding. I believe having a portfolio project like this can open up new career opportunities. Hopefully, it will make a strong impression on recruiters by demonstrating my enthusiasm and curiosity.
# Project Information
