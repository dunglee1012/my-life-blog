# Introduction

Hello everyone! If you're looking at this project, it means you're either a very close friend of mine... or a recruiter. Regardless of who you are, I hope you enjoy this masterpiece (well, it's a masterpiece in my heart 😵‍💫).  

### About Me  

This project was created by me and only me 🥺 huhu.  
I once thought, "Why not create a website that can express the things I can't say myself?" (Well, more like I'm too lazy to say them). After over two years of laziness, this project is finally here (mainly because I had to focus on my graduation project and making money 🥱).  

Enough chit-chat...  

Hi everyone, I'm **Dũng**, but my friends call me **Dle (Đờ le)**. I'm currently 24 years old and working as a developer for an outsourcing company.  
I feel that having a **personal project** like this can help me a lot when looking for new opportunities. Hopefully, it will make a great impression on recruiters by showcasing my enthusiasm, passion, and curiosity.  
Even the toughest recruiter might melt under the charm of my "strange yet lovable" personality (not my words, my female colleagues often tell me I'm cute and handsome 🤣).  

# Project Information  

This project is a **personal blog** built using **Next.js** and **Firebase**, allowing the owner to post blogs while visitors can comment and rate posts.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

### 🚀 Frontend (UI & Client-side)  
- **Next.js** – A React framework optimized for SEO and performance. It allows server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for fast page loads.  
- **React.js** – A component-based JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.  
- **Tailwind CSS** *(Optional)* – A utility-first CSS framework that helps style components quickly and efficiently.  

### 🗄️ Backend & Database  
- **Firebase Firestore** – A NoSQL cloud database that stores blog posts and comments. It supports real-time updates for live interactions.  
- **Firebase Authentication** – Provides secure user authentication with Google login (only the owner can post blogs).  
- **Next.js API Routes** – Used to handle backend logic, such as managing comments and likes, without needing a separate backend server.  

### ⚡ Features & Optimization  
- **Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** – Combines static generation and real-time updates, improving SEO and performance while reducing Firebase reads.
- **Next.js API Routes** – Allows the creation of serverless functions within the app, removing the need for an external backend.  
- **ESLint + Prettier** – Ensures clean, formatted, and error-free code.  
- **Turbopack/Webpack** – Optimizes build speed and performance in development.  

### ☁️ Deployment & Hosting  
- **Vercel** – A cloud platform optimized for deploying Next.js applications. It provides automatic builds and previews.  
- **GitHub** – Used for version control, allowing collaboration and CI/CD integration.
