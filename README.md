# Introduction

Hello everyone! If you're looking at this project, it means you're either a very close friend of mine... or a recruiter. Regardless of who you are, I hope you enjoy this masterpiece (well, it's a masterpiece in my heart 😵‍💫).  

### About Me  

This project was created by me and only me 🥺 huhu.  
I once thought, "Why not create a website that can express the things I can't say myself?" (Well, more like I'm too lazy to say them). After over two years of laziness, this project is finally here (mainly because I had to focus on my graduation project and making money 🥱).  

Enough chit-chat...  

Hi everyone, I'm **Dũng**, but my friends call me **Dle (Đờ le)**. I'm currently 24 years old and working as a developer for an outsourcing company.  
I feel that having a **personal project** like this can help me a lot when looking for new opportunities. Hopefully, it will make a great impression on recruiters by showcasing my enthusiasm, passion, and curiosity.  
Even the toughest recruiter might melt under the charm of my "strange yet lovable" personality (not my words, my female colleagues often tell me I'm cute and handsome 🤣).
